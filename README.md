### Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua, CTO [@blaueQuelle](https://www.blauequelle.de/) & web developer from Göttingen in Germany.

- 💻 I’m working as a full stack web developer since 2011 (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and all the nice stuff around them)
- 👨🏼‍💻 My current tech stack includes either [Statamic](https://github.com/statamic/statamic) or [ProcessWire](https://github.com/processwire/processwire) as backend / CMS.  
On the frontend it varies between a rock solid [SCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass) stack and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). For the JS part of the frontend I prefer to use [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for most projects
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
